# (south African) A bush (''[[Aspalanthus linearis]]'') from which [[rooibos tea]] is made.
#* Antioxidants are hot topics in the health news these days, and an [[herbal]] tea called '''rooibos''' (pronounced ROY-boss) is becoming popular partly because it is being marketed as a healthful [[beverage]] with high levels of antioxidants. The '''rooibos''' plant (''Aspalathus linearis'' (Burm. f.) Dahlgren, Fabaceae) is a South African flowering shrub used to make a mild-tasting tea that has no [[caffeine]], very little [[tannin]], and significant amounts of polyphenol [[antioxidant]]s.
